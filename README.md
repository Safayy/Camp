## Description
Developing countries utilize different phones specifications on average that developed countries. These smartphones are cheaper to buy but have drawbacks with speed and storage capacity. The average storage capacity in India in 2018 was only 16GB. In fact, 83% of smartphone users in India admitted to resort to deleting apps to free up storage. A survey by Western Digital SanDisk, showed that 65% of all smartphone users have a phone with storage of 16GB or less. This makes it hard to store files in their phones without continuously deleting files on a regular basis. In countries, such as Sudan, the internet turns on sporadically, being turning off for days at a time. This prevents streaming songs and other media. Additionally, developing countries experience less bandwidth, making streaming of media difficult. The frequent data breaches on social media, prevent the trusting of online storage companies, as well as their overwhelming cost and need for internet.
